# home-automation
Main ladder logic program for the PLC. To use, you'll need a [PLC from Automation Direct](https://www.automationdirect.com/adc/Shopping/Catalog/Programmable_Controllers) and accompanying I/O modules from Automation Direct, as well as the [software](http://support.automationdirect.com/products/clickplcs.html) to edit and load it.

Substitute your own PLC model if desired, or don't use one at all. OpenHab is very flexible in what it will talk to, and powerful enough to run all automation on its own.
